===============

A wee script to visualize the distribution of illustrations (decoNote) and contents (msItem) in manuscripts from the Walters Art Museum

Get TEI manuscript descriptions to use with these stylesheets at http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/ManuscriptDescriptions/

Work will continue. To do:
* Look at including quireing as part of the view (show where new quires start)
* Background colors for TOC (to show expanses of contents, not just where they start)
* Be more thoughtful about what contents to include
